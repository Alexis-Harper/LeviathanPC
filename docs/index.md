# The Game Plan

The Leviathan is a game project created by Michael Bledsoe to create a complete game, with the final goal of getting it on Steam.

The game code is open source, and you have the right to copy and reproduce our game as you wish, but you must include and follow the GNU Public Liscense guidelines. We have the right to sell our product binaries while providing an open source policy for the code. 

# Game Usage

The game just run normally will run normal, but using command line argumants you can change the way the game runs. 

Using a filepath as the first argumant will cause that to be used as the starter arena file. This can be used for debugging a specific area or boss, or for loading up custom mod arenas, which can be chained together to create an entirely new story and areas.
